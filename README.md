This is a [CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) project written in TypeScript
that sets up a CloudFormation stack which cleans up left-over stacks and log
groups from CI runs.

Although your CI tests _should_ clean up after themselves, there still might be
stacks and log groups that get not cleaned up perfectly. This stack runs a
lambda every hour, which deletes stacks and log groups that have a certain
prefix and are older than 24 hours.

## Install

    git clone https://github.com/bifravst/cloudformation-cleaner
    npm ci

## Setup in your CI account

> Note: you should only set this up in an account where every CloudFormation
> stack can be deleted, because this lambda has the permissions to delete
> everything.

    npx cdk deploy

### Configuration

You can configure the regular expression used to check against a resources names
according to the following table

| Lambda              | SSM Parameter Name                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `stack-cleaner`     | `/${stackName}/stackNameRegEx`     |
| `log-group-cleaner` | `/${stackName}/logGroupNameRegEx`  |
| `role-cleaner`      | `/${stackName}/roleNameRegEx`      |
| `buckets-cleaner`   | `/${stackName}/bucketNameRegEx`    |
| `parameter-cleaner` | `/${stackName}/parameterNameRegEx` |

You can configure this from the command line:

```bash
aws ssm put-parameter --name /cloudformation-cleaner/stackNameRegEx --value '^(some-pattern|another-pattern)-' --overwrite
```

## Running from the command line

```bash
npx tsx ./cli.ts
```
